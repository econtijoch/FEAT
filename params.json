To do this, simply type the following into the R command line:</p>\r\n\r\n\tsource(\"https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")\r\n\tbiocLite(\"rhdf5\")\r\n\tbiocLite(\"phyloseq\")\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To launch the Shiny app, simply load the package and run the launchFEAT() command.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, you can run it directly from GitHub:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\trequire(shiny)\r\n\trunGitHub('econtijoch/FEAT/', subdir = 'inst/shiny-FEAT/')\r\n\r\n\r\n",
